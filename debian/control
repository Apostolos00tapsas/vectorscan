Description: Portable fork of Intel's Hyperscan library (development files)
 Vectorscan is a portable fork of Intel's Hyperscan project. It is a drop-in
 replacement that promises to be API/ABI compatible with the original project,
 while allowing it to run on other architectures such as AArch64 and Power9.
 .
 This package contains development libraries, header files and documentation for
 the regular expression matching library libhyperscan. You can either use the
 supplied shared or static library.
 .
 Vectorscan only runs on CPUs with a SIMD unit. On x86 CPUs, the minimum
 requirement is SSE4.2, AArch64 ISA already implies Advanced SIMD/NEON and
 ppc64le (Power8/Power9) already implies VSX enabled by default.

Description: Portable fork of Intel's Hyperscan library
 Vectorscan is a portable fork of Intel's Hyperscan project. It is a drop-in
 replacement that promises to be API/ABI compatible with the original project,
 while allowing it to run on other architectures such as AArch64 and Power9.
 .
 Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library.
 It follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library,
 but is a standalone library with its own C API. Hyperscan uses hybrid automata
 techniques to allow simultaneous matching of large numbers (up to tens of
 thousands) of regular expressions and for the matching of regular expressions
 across streams of data. Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.
 .
 Vectorscan only runs on CPUs with a SIMD unit. On x86 CPUs, the minimum
 requirement is SSE4.2, AArch64 ISA already implies Advanced SIMD/NEON and
 ppc64le (Power8/Power9) already implies VSX enabled by default.
